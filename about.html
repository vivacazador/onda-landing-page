									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/hunter.png" alt="" /></span>Hunter grew up in a farming family, spending his high school summers working on a tractor or digging ditches. During college, he ran a large weed abatement business using goats to clear weeds and fire hazards along the Central Coast. After graduating, he worked in product development for a California seed dealer. Hunter took a gap year in Mexico, surfing and building a restaurant business that supports a local children's home. A self-taught programmer, he is driven to improve agriculture through technology. He believes all companies need to become tech companies in the coming decade and is dedicated to providing agricultural businesses with the resources to achieve this transformation. </p>
